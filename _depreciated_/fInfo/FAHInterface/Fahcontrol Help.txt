                              If no name arguments are given then all options
                              with non-default values will be listed. If the
                              '-d' argument is given then even defaulted options
                              will be listed. If the '-a' option is given then
                              even unset options will be listed. Otherwise, if

                              unset. This way an unset option can be
                              differentiated from an option with an empty value.
                              Options which are named but don't exists are
